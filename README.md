# hello-world
This is Harwinder Singh. I am a student of Web development and internet apllications fundamental from conestoga college ( Waterloo Campus ). I chose this course because I have always been curious about how these websites are made, and work. Website design for me is like a platform where I can challenge my abilities and in these cut competitive world I can prove myself. The world is now expanding and people are getting connected via source of internet and wedsite are like links where they get to share and connect with their business, relatives and friends living far away from them. Ofcourse the reason is simple, this course will lead me to the glory of main stream website designing world where employees get paid handsome amount of money. However, for me other significant thing is that i want to build a website for my ownself as I love photography and videography (it is my hobby, I will be feeling grateful i it turns into my extra source of income ). last but not least I want to hone my knowledge of web coding and interactive world of web development.
 
Thanks
Harwinder Singh
